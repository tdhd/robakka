# robakka

robakka is a programming game in scala. It is based on akka (http://akka.io) to model the agents in the game. Also it is not round based but implemented to allow the agents to react in real-time to events.

This game is inspired by RobotWar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RobotWar) and cells (https://github.com/phreeza/cells).

### Why robakka?

robakka is a combination of robot and akka, the underlying modelling framework of the agents.
